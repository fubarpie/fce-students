impactStatement: The scholarship program has different projects and each one
  works in a certain sector of the community. I have also been able to observe

  access to higher education and thus improve our lives, that of our family and
  community.

  computer engineering, during these two years of high school I will decide
  which, but they are the university degrees that I like the most, I would also
  like to work in something that has to do with the degree that I have studied,
  I would like this job to fill me with satisfaction and allow me to have a
  dignified life and be able to help my family and community. Another thing that
  I would like to do is travel to France and continue my professional training.
