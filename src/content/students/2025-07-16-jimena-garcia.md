impactStatement: Entering the scholarship program makes me happy, because thanks
  to the financial aid I can supplement the money for my school expenses, since
  in high school I have to attend school almost all day and therefore I have to
  buy my lunch, in addition It will help me to be able to cover stationery
  expenses. My family is also happy for this opportunity, as it somehow ensures
  that I can continue with my study plans in the future. If I don't have this
  scholarship, I should look for other ways to get ahead, maybe I would have to
  work to pay for a university degree. I hope to learn many good things that
  will help me improve my life as a student and as a person.
aspirations: After studying my baccalaureate I would like to study dentistry at
  the Don Bosco University, I think it is a very nice career and which can
  provide me with better job opportunities that would help me have a stable life
  and thus be able to support my family. After graduating from university I
  would like to have my own practice, I also want to support my community in the
  different activities they carry out to improve the conditions in which we
  live.
