impactStatement: First, it is a pleasure to be part of this program, because it
  created great opportunities in my life. Thanks to the scholarship, I have been
  able to continue studying and working to achieve my goals. My family is happy
  because my brother and sister have just started university. I also want to
  emphasize the current situation, because our university environment during the
  pandemic has been difficult. I look around me and I realize that the support
  of this program is a blessing, because some of my classmates have dropped out
  of school due to lack of financial resources. Itâ€™s a shame to see people who
  potential and a desire to improve themselves but are simply unable to go on. I
  feel so grateful to God and the CIS for creating an opportunity for success in
  my life.
aspirations: When I am a professional, I want to work and support my parents.
  Then I would like to start a language academy that offers courses at
  affordable rates and provides scholarships to young people who want to learn a
  new language. I also want to offer my support to the CIS, because they were
  there for me when I needed them most. Soon I will be graduate and begin my
  professional career thanks to the CIS. Finally, I would like to travel to
  Italy to learn the language and bring it home to teach to the young people of
  my country.
obstacles: 2020 was difficult. Classes went online, and reliable internet is a
  big expense for a poor family. But the CIS gave us computers and internet,
  which helped us through our online classes and was a great motivation to keep
  going.
