impactStatement: The scholarship program has been very important to my education
  from the beginning. Before I knew about the program, it was ridiculous to
  think that I could go to university. Thanks to the Scholarship Project, a
  whole world of possibilities has opened up before me.
aspirations: I dream of being able to run a business of my own one day, or
  failing that, find a high administrative position within a company and with
  strong environmental values so that I can support my family and the
  scholarship program.
obstacles: The biggest obstacle is crime, since it has not allowed me to travel
  safely. Just last year this prevented me from studying English. Another
  difficulty is the distance between the university and my home. This year, with
  online classes, poor internet signal has become a big problem, along with the
  tools availableâ€”I was forced to get a better cell phone, as well as a
  computer.
