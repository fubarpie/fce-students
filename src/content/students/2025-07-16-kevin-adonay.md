impactStatement: The scholarship program is essential to be able to continue
  with my studies and with my professional training. I am a young man with
  limited economic resources and the program helps me cover many of my study
  expenses. It has also helped me to grow as a person by promoting good values.
  It not only impacts me, but also my family since I am the first to attend
  university.
aspirations: I want to continue studying the English language and become a
  professional dancer, because dance is something that I am passionate about and
  have a talent for. I would also like to carry out social and humanitarian work
  in my community because I feel very committed to improving the lives of other
  people and I have a spirit of helping others.
obstacles: Economic factors are the main obstacles to continue with my
  education, along with family issues, transportation difficulties, and the
  security concerns that are so common in Salvadoran communities. It can
  sometimes be hard to stay motivated.
