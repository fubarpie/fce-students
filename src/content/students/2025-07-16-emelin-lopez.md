currentGradeLevel: 3rd Year
graduationYearExpected: "2028"
communityProject: Educacion Formativa
impactStatement: A pleasant impact, because I will be able to continue my
  studies and will be the first in my family to have the opportunity to study
  for a professional degree. In addition, the scholarship program will help me
  not only intellectually, but also to form myself as a person because our
  social projects help us understand the problems we face as a community.
aspirations: After graduating from high school I would like to get a bachelorâ€™s
  degree in business administration. After finishing my studies at university, I
  would like to work to support my family, cooperate in some way in my community
  and encourage other young people to continue studying.
obstacles: The most difficult thing has been adapting to online classes. Because
  we have no direct contact with teachers, if we have questions we have to
  contact the teachers through WhatsApp messages, and usually they take a while
  to answer. Also, I have had connection problems due to the poor signal in the
  area.
