impactStatement: For me it has been a great impact to have obtained this
  scholarship. It is a great opportunity for my academic and personal
  improvement. I believe I will learn a lot from our social projects, and from
  working and cooperating with colleagues.
aspirations: After graduating from high school I would like to get a bachelor's
  degree in English, education, or foreign languages. After finishing my
  university degree I would like to work in a school. I would like to help my
  family and the community in any way I can.
obstacles: Due to the pandemic and the new class format that has come with it,
  the internet has become an indispensable resource. At the beginning of all
  this it was very difficult to get online due to connection problems.
  Communication with teachers is more difficult online and that causes a lot of
  problems since they canâ€™t give us the support we need.
