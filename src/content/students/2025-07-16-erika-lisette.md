impactStatement: A positive impact, because it has allowed me to continue
  studying and many do not have that opportunity. In addition, it has helped me
  to integrate with other people, to be a person in solidarity, and above all to
  do good and positive things that we can share with the community.
aspirations: After completing my high school diploma, I want to study for a
  university degree. Then I would like to get a decent job and help my family
  financially, contribute to the personal growth of those around me, and also do
  positive things in my community.
obstacles: I think the biggest thing has been the lack of money in my family. My
  parents find it difficult to pay for basic services at home and also to pay
  for my studies. My father is the only member of the family who works, so he
  has to pay for the education of three children on his own.
