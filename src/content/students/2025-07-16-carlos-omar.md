impactStatement: The scholarship program has had a great impact on my life,
  because thanks to the program I will be able to continue my studies at
  university. I have also met many other people who belong to the program.
aspirations: What I want to do at the end of my university degree is get a job,
  learn more about what I have studied, and have enough income to help my

  studies so that they can also overcome their obstacles and get university
  degrees.

  problems, since I often do not have enough money to do some tasks or
  activities. Health problems have also prevented me from attending classes
  sometimes.
