impactStatement: It is a great opportunity, because I'm learning new things,
  seeing how many of my classmates are about to graduate motivates me to follow
  their example. The program teaches us to support each other just as the
  program is supporting us.
aspirations: What I want to do after finishing university is work a dignified
  job, help my family, and also contribute to my community so that other young
  people can pursue their university studies. I hope to be an example for other
  young people to follow.
obstacles: One of the biggest obstacles is financial. In a time when all of our
  classes have been moved online, not having access to a good computer or
  reliable internet can make it difficult to continue our studies.
