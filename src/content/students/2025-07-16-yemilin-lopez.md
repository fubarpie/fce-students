impactStatement: It has had a great impact, since it will give me the
  opportunity to go to university, and be able to overcome my obstacles and gain
  a professional degree. It also helps me to be able to express myself better
  through sharing with others, and learn from the projects that exist in the
  program. It also helps to contribute to the growth of others.
aspirations: After high school, I want to improve myself by studying for a
  university degree and then find a decent job and fulfill other goals such as
  helping my parents financially and fixing the house where we live. I also want
  to contribute positive things to my community.
obstacles: In this last year I think my biggest challenge has been the new study
  format. Because of the pandemic we are not studying face to face in school and
  we have to do everything online. Sometimes the internet cuts out and we canâ€™t
  understand, and sometimes the teachers do not explain the homework well.
