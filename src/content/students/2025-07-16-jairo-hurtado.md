communityProject: Educacion Formativa
impactStatement: The program because it has helped me to develop myself as a
  person. I have learned new things and gained new skills as part of the
  Education and Training project. As a part of this project, I have learned
  about issues such as the environment, sexuality, and violence against women.
  Thanks for all the great positive impact that the program has had. Even in
  difficult times like these, I have been able to move forward.
aspirations: To work, use my professional skill, and have a salary that allows
  me to help my parents. I want to be able to start my own family and get a car.
  Of course I also plan on supporting the scholarship committee and its
  community projects, as well as giving a scholarship to another young person
  like me so that they can have the same opportunities I had.
obstacles: The pandemic has caused a lot of problems, because all of our classes
  went online, and not all of us have access to good internet. I even missed a
  test and failed a class because of internet problems. It was quite
  frustrating, because to be honest I deserved to pass. But, thank God now we
  have better internet and computers from the scholarship program.
