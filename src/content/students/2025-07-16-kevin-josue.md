impactStatement: It has had a great positive impact on my life, since with the
  help of the scholarship program, I have been able to continue growing,
  creating a great person for society. Also, without financial aid I could not
  continue my studies, and that is a problem because these days it is necessary
  to have a good education in order to apply for a good job. I am grateful,
  because there are a lot of other young people who can’t continue their
  studies.
aspirations: After finishing my university studies, I want to work so that I can
  help my parents, be independent, have a home, build a family, and in short be
  able to do everything I have always wanted and contribute to my community.
obstacles: The biggest obstacle is financial, most do not have the resources
  they need to continue their studies. Another obstacle is the lack of security.
  There is always that fear of leaving home and not coming back.
