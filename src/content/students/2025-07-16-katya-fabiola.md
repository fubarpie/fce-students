impactStatement: A positive impact, as the program seeks to create new
  opportunities and to prepare young people to have a better future and become
  leaders in their communities who contribute a little to changing the reality
  that we face day to day.
aspirations: I want to get a decent job and help my mom financially and repay
  her for everything she’s done for me. Not only that, but also I would like to
  support other young people in the future so that they can study and our
  community continues to move forward.
obstacles: Well most recently the pandemic. Classes are harder when you can’t
  get immediate advice from teachers, and sometimes our internet signal is not
  very good and it is difficult to attend classes or turn in homework.
