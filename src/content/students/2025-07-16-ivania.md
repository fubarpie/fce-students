impactStatement: For me and my family it has been a great blessing, because
  thanks to this program I and other young people have been able to continue our
  studies. Before acquiring the scholarship, I was struggling with whether or
  not to continue studying, and the idea of getting a job was starting to look
  more realistic. But thanks to this program I have been able to continue
  studying after graduating from high school. I thank the CIS so much for giving
  me this opportunity to continue my plan to become a professional chemist.
aspirations: After Finishing my technical degree, I hope to find a job in my
  field, and be able to help my grandparents financially. I also want to help
  other people who have similar goals to become a professional as well.
obstacles: My greatest obstacle has been my finances, since my grandparents no
  longer work and the only person who helps us financially is an uncle. Before
  being selected for the scholarship, it was frustrating to think that I would
  have to put my future on hold, but the CIS has allowed me to continue moving
  forward and been a great blessing to me and my grandparents.
