status: Thesis/Internship
schoolName: Dr. Andrés Bello University
majorOrFieldOfStudy: Nursing
impactStatement: Mainly self-improvement, because the program has helped me to
  define goals and achieve them with the support of those who make up the
  scholarship program. We have built strong bonds of friendship among the group
  of students.
aspirations: Get a job in my field in order to continue helping my community and
  my family. As a nurse, the people of the community will often come to consult
  with you about their health, I want to help all the people around me who need
  it. I will also continue to participate in the activities that the program
  does for the good of the community.
obstacles: Mainly finances. as in many cases, the university unexpectedly
  requires large payments to do clinical rotations, and I often don’t have the
  money to make them. Another issue is crime. Whether in the streets or on
  buses, you can't travel with peace of mind thinking that at any moment,
  someone can walk up and ask for the little money you have. Finally, the
  pandemic. because the online classes are not the same as a class face-to-face.
  It also makes it harder to go to a hospital to to do a clinical rotation. The
  pandemic has delayed my graduation by nearly a full semester.
