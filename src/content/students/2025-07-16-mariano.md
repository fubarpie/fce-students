majorOrFieldOfStudy: Business Administration
communityProject: Agua Limpia
impactStatement: Participating in the scholarship program has improved my life,
  as well as my familyâ€™s. I have managed to complete my university degree, my
  brothers have been able to continue studying because my parents can invest
  more in their education, I have learned English, and I have had incredible
  life-changing experiences. Thanks to the scholarship program, I am now a
  person with more social awareness.
aspirations: "After I finish my degree I have several plans: to pursue my
  master's degree in Financial Management, improve my English, study
  international marketing, help more young people to continue their studies, and
  work to further develop my community. We have a plan to reunify the whole
  community of Hawthorn, as at the moment it is separated by crime. I also want
  to set up study centres and libraries in the community, including recreation
  centers, cultural centers, a skill development center, and even an English
  language teaching center."
obstacles: Probably crime, because we cannot move freely and do our projects.
  There is always a fear of something happening, since gangs have control over a
  large part of the country.
