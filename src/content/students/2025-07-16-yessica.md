status: Graduated
graduationYearExpected: "2023"
impactStatement: It has been a great blessing for the community, and I thank God
  that He put the scholarship program in my path, which has changed my life and
  allowed me to continue with my higher studies.
aspirations: First, after graduating, I hope to get a job and use my income to
  help other young people continue with their studies, just as the CIS helped me
  to continue with mine. I also want to help my family, because they have also
  given me a lot of trust and support.
obstacles: One of the biggest obstacles is crime, since it keeps us from moving
  freely and affects education. Everyone here is living with some kind of
  trauma. Another obstacle is the pandemic, since it makes it more difficult for
  us to receive classes.
