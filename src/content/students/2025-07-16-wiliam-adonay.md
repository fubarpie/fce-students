impactStatement: Thanks to the CIS and their scholarship program, I was able to
  continue my university studies. It was quite difficult for me to continue
  studying, because I have two brothers who are studying in university and they
  need the support. The CIS has been a great source of support in my education.
  That is why I am eternally grateful for this wonderful program.
aspirations: At the end of my studies I want to get a stable job in which I am
  given the opportunity to continue specializing in field and support my family
  and the community.
obstacles: My obstacles have been financial, because it is quite difficult for
  me to get to and from classes and pay for class materials.
