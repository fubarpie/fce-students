impactStatement: Being a part of the scholarship program changed my life in a
  big way because every day I learn to see things differently, because not only
  do they support us financially, but they also support us morally. Before being
  part of the program I saw studying simply as a way to improve my own
  conditions, but living with the other students and hearing their stories has
  made me realize that I have to move forward to elevate not only myself, but
  also my family and my community. In addition, seeing students that have
  already graduated motivates me to not give up when I feel that things are not
  going well.
aspirations: When I finish my degree, I would like to find a stable job and pay
  for a master's degree or another bachelor’s. In addition to contributing to
  the scholarship program so that other young people continue studying, I would
  like to be an example for those who are starting out and motivate them so that
  they know that anything is possible if we strive.
obstacles: The start of the pandemic was a struggle, because I had never taken
  online classes before. What’s more, our workload increased because we now have
  to lean many classroom topics on our own; a lot of teachers simply send us
  information, and getting in touch with them directly with questions can be
  very difficult. That actually disappointed me a lot, but over time I am
  adapting and I no longer find it so difficult. I just need to invest more time
  and patience.
