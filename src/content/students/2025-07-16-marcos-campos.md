impactStatement: First of all, I feel happy because it has been a great
  opportunity to continue studying, since not everyone has access to a
  scholarship. In addition, it is a great privilege for me to be part of the CIS
  since thanks to your support I will be able to continue at the University
  level.
aspirations: After finishing high school, I want to study computer systems
  engineering at university, then get a stable job to help my family, become
  independent and buy my own home in addition to supporting more young people
  like me.
obstacles: My biggest obstacle has been my economic situation, since sometimes I
  do not have enough money to get the books and documents I need for my classes,
  and I have no support from my father. At the same time, the transition to
  online classes has made it harder to get advice and guidance from my teachers.
