impactStatement: A great impact, because thanks to the financial support they
  give us in the program, I can make payments to have internet and thus continue
  my studies; itâ€™s vital to be able to send, receive and complete homework
  assignments. In addition, I have learned to be more supportive and to be able
  to share with others.
aspirations: God willing, I would like to get a stable job in the area that I
  decide to study. I would also like to be able to afford things such as my own
  house, a vehicle, trips to other countries, and further university education.
obstacles: Mostly they have been economic, since you need to buy materials to
  complete homework assignments, and this has been an obstacle for me and my
  family. In addition, the pandemic has fundamentally changed how people
  interact with the world. At first it was very difficult to get used to the new
  normal, but as time passed we have become accustomed to it. Still, I think the
  pandemic has been a big obstacle for everyone.
